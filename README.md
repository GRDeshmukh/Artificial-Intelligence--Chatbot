# AI Chatbot
This is my Artificial Intelligence Assignment.

In this Assignment I build an AI contextual Chatbot using the tensorflow and tflearn library
I used the concepts of Natural Language Processing and Neural Network to build it.
The intents file that we used for training is made by us.

# Dependencies
1. pip3 install nltk
2. pip3 install tensorflow==1.13.2
3. pip3 install numpy
4. pip3 install tflearn
5. pip3 install random
6. pip3 install json

# Use Cases
In this technological world every industry run behind AI and automation. One of the best application of integration of AI and Automation would be Chatbots. These are heavily used now-a-days. There are many diferent use cases of Chatbots in indutries. Some of them are,

1. Saves labour work
2. Provides 24x7 support
3. Instant service
4. Can entertain more number of people at same time
5. Easy Communication, etc

# How to run ?
To run this application you can use jupyter notebook and open this file with jupyter notebook. Run each cell of notebook.
After you run every cell, you can call response() method and put your query within it.
for eg : 

response("What is the location of your company?")


This Chatbot is primarly focused for an CyberSecurity based Industry. It can be a customer care Chatbot by using which you can know which kind of services does the Cyber Industry provides. Also you can use this chatbot to know some basic terminologies in Cyber Industry like ;
What is cryptography ?, What is Hashing ?, etc. 

Also by using Flask or with other web technologies you can use this chatbot to embeed in your website and can change the intent file as per your requirement and enhace the performance of your website.
Now-a-days everything getting automated. One of the best example of automation would be Chatbots. In this technological world where every thing is being automated you can also automate customer services by using an AI Chatbot.
